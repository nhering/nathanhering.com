PROJECTS ------------------------------------------------------
Over the course of the past few months I have learned a great deal about software development by applying that knowledge in various projects. Here is a list of the diverse experiences I’ve had.
* SQL – Relational database creation via stored procedure. Database emulated a library of users, authors, publishers, library branches, and books. Created multiple stored procedures to query based on joining the tables. GitHub link
* Python – Created a file transfer application that filters files to copy based on modify date of the selected files. Functionality also includes database creation to save recently selected folders and creates ‘profiles’ that can be reused and updated. GitHub link
* JavaScript – Designed a dynamic web page emulating an ordering process for a pizza restaurant. Features include real-time tabulation of price based on selections made by the user. GitHub link
* ASP.NET MVC – Constructed a mock insurance company web application. Features included a quote generator, and CRUD operations on a database, and user login functionality.
* C# – Made a simple slot machine game which randomized images, calculated jackpot based on combination, and tracked user winnings/losses using view state.
* MS Excel – Developed an application designed to mitigate inconsistency in core business processes at a Portland based internet provider. The application combines department efforts from customer discovery, to engineering, and through to bidding on projects. It also provides a place for executives to adjust overhead costs and know that it will be effectively reflected when sales representatives build quotes.
